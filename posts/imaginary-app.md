My app is made for productivity, focus, help people completing their goals and making dream come true day by day.

However ...

In this app there you can make houses for each thing which is successes for you in that particular year, you can also design your house as you want and in each house there are 21 levels 

> Because each good habit takes at least 21 days 
> to come in your daily life time same goes for 
> bad habit it at least take 21 days to leave in 
> your daily life time. 

You get money for buying your characters, you can also take breaks for 1 or 2 days as well. For each year we make some resolutionâ€™s for example I am going to get plus 90% in exam this year so in one house you will get 21 rooms for making it your habit after those 21 days we are going to ask if it worked or not yes $ 1000 (fake) if not $ 500 (fake) and we are going to start it again with another house. For each month you will be able to make 1 to 5 house and for each house there are 21 levels, 5 new character for each new months will be updated if you lose one character you to buy it with those $ 500 (fake). 

The more you get closer to your goal the more your houses, rooms and amount of money gets bigger. And the most fun part of this App is that it totally free so every single person who installs this app can use it without any problem but you might get some adds.
